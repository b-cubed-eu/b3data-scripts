```

# Goal

Create [frictionless](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) data package with example datasets (occurrence cubes) for the [b3verse](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/guides/b3verse/).

# Methods

This report focuses on creating the **b3data** frictionless data package for tabular datasets.  
A separate report adds spatial resources (e.g. GeoJSON, raster) to the same data package.

## Data Package Overview

- **Name**: `b3data`
- **Location**: `b3data-scripts/data/b3data_package/`
- **Published at**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (DOI to be reserved)
- **Used in**: [b3verse](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/guides/b3verse/)
- **Importable in R via**: [`frictionless`](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) R package

## Source Data

Tabular data is downloaded from **GBIF** using the [`rgbif`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/) package.

Each dataset (resource) corresponds to an **occurrence cube** and follows this naming convention:

```
resource_name = "<taxon>cube<region>_<grid><resolution>"
```

Example:  
`bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10` â†’ bird occurrences in Belgium using the MGRS grid (10 km resolution)

## Resource-level Metadata

Each dataset includes the following metadata (see: [Frictionless resource spec](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/articles/data-resource.html#properties-implementation)):

- **title**: e.g. `"Occurrence cube for birds in Belgium (MGRS 10 km)"`
- **description**: concise explanation of content, region, time period, method
- **sources**: GBIF DOI
- **licenses**: [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) (based on GBIF source license)

## Package-level Metadata

Metadata for the entire data package (see: [Frictionless Data Package spec](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#metadata)):

- **name**: `b3data`
- **id**: reserved Zenodo DOI
- **title**: `b3data: Data resources for the b3verse`
- **description**: overview of purpose, content, and structure of the data package
- **keywords**: e.g. `"biodiversity", "data cube", "b3verse", "GBIF", "frictionless"`
- **licenses**: [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
- **version**: semantic versioning string, e.g. 0.1.0
- **sources**: GitHub repository [b3data-scripts](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/b3data-scripts)
- **contributors**: name, ORCID, and roles

# Datasets
## Birds in Belgium (MGRS 10 km)

As example dataset on small scale, we include an occurrence cube of birds in Belgium between 2000 en 2024.
The taxonomical resolution is "species" and the temporal resolution is "year".
For aggregation, we choose the MGRS grid at 10 km scale.

```{r}
# nolint start: line_length_linter.
bird_cube_query <- "SELECT
  \"year\",
  GBIF_MGRSCode(10000, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude,
  COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS mgrsCode,
  speciesKey,
  species,
  family,
  COUNT(*) AS n,
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters,
  IF(ISNULL(family), NULL, SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY family)) AS familyCount
  FROM
  occurrence
  WHERE
  occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'ZERO_COORDINATE')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COORDINATE_INVALID')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND countryCode = 'BE'
  AND \"year\" >= 2000
  AND \"year\" <= 2024
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND decimalLongitude IS NOT NULL
  AND class = 'Aves'
  GROUP BY
  \"year\",
  mgrsCode,
  speciesKey,
  family,
  species
  ORDER BY
  \"year\" ASC,
  mgrsCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC"
# nolint end

# Download and load cube
bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10_full <- download_occ_cube(
  sql_query = bird_cube_query,
  file = "bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10.csv",
  path = data_path,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
```

We only select the grid cells that belong to the MGRS 10 km reference grid for the mainland of Belgium (see b3data `mgrs10_refgrid_belgium.geojson`).

```{r}
# Read reference grid
utm10_bel <- st_read(file.path(data_path, "utm10_bel.shp"))

# Visualise
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = utm10_bel)
```

```{r}
# Only select grid cells from reference grid
bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10 <- bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10_full %>%
  filter(substring(mgrscode, 4) %in% utm10_bel$TAG)
```

We create the package and add the dataset.

```{r}
b3data_package <- create_package() %>%
  add_resource(
    resource_name = "bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10",
    data = bird_cube_belgium_mgrs10,
    title = "Occurrence cube for birds in Belgium (MGRS 10 km)",
    description = paste(
      "Occurrence cube for birds in Belgium between 2000 en 2024.",
      "The taxonomical resolution is 'species' and",
      "the temporal resolution is 'year'",
      "Spatial aggregation is done using the MGRS grid at 10 km scale.",
      "Only grid cells that fall within the 10 km MGRS reference grid for",
      "mainland Belgium (see b3data: `mgrs10_refgrid_belgium.geojson`) are",
      "included."),
    sources = c(

# Warning: append() drops the custom datapackage class.

We write the package to the directory.

```{r}
# Create directory

dir.create(package_path, showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

# Write package to directory
write_package(
